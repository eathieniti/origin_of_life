Phospholipids in aqueous solutions arrange themselves in micelles. This is a response to their amphipathic nature; they contain both hydrophilic regions and hydrophobic.


# Discrete lattice Model
## Discrete Orientation
micelle_lattice_v3.py

## Continuous orientation

# Continuous model 
The model with continuous motion for the lipids, but discrete timestep
## 2-point lipids
Run "python continuous_model.py"
To obtain a simulation of the 2 point-lipids continuous model



## 3-point lipids

Run "continuous_model_3point.py"
To obtain a simulation of the 3 point-lipids continuous model

  ### Experiments
  "continuous_model_3point_min_tail_change.py"
  
  This is an extension of the 3-point lipids model to change the min_tail_distance in the same run. This is to show the transition from micelles to bilayers
