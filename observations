Observations from simulations

-> Varying dir_step_size
	val = 0.0	undirected movement
			tails tend to rotate towards each other (small tendency to micell)
			micells fall apart from noise
			1 numerical error
	val = 0.001	(N=300) there is tendency of clustering of tails, however no micells 3 or 4 numerical errors
			(N=1000) 
	val = 0.05	(N=300) clear tendency for the tails to cluster
			a lot of numerical errors
			with increase of N, the wiggling could result in the merge of micells
	val = 0.1	strong clustering
			a lot of numerical errors
			the wiggling (noise) is not strong enough to make the micells diffuse
	val = 0.2	a very strong tendency to cluster, potential micells are even disrupted to create a large hub
			a lot of numerical errors
	val = 0.3	the tendency to cluster is so large that hubs merge
			a lot of numerical errors
