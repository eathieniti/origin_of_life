Observations from simulations

-> Varying dir_step_size
	val = 0.0	(N=300) undirected movement
			tails tend to rotate towards each other (small tendency to micell)
			micells fall apart from noise
			1 numerical error
	val = 0.001	(N=1000, noise_scale=0.1) a slight directed movement, but the noise is too large for actual improvement of the system
			(N=1000, noise_scale= 0.001) 
	val = 0.01	(N=300) there is tendency of clustering of tails, however no micells 3 or 4 numerical errors
			(N=1000) clear tendency of clustering, micells are large and unstable. the noise seems to be too large for clear cluster formation
			(N=2841) again, tendency to cluster. the noise seems to be too large for stable micells, however, clusters are clearly formed.
	val = 0.02	(N=1000) cluster formation, slowly
	val = 0.03	(N=1000) clustering is clear, although the systems takes a long time for traveling through the domain. There seems to be membrane formation if it wasn't for the strong tendency to form micells
	val = 0.04	(N=1000) clustering is clear
	val = 0.05	(N=300) clear tendency for the tails to cluster
			a lot of numerical errors
			with increase of N, the wiggling could result in the merge of micells
			(N=1000) again a lot of numerical errors. there are clear clusters formed, though clear micells yet.
	val = 0.1	(N=300) strong clustering
			a lot of numerical errors
			the wiggling (noise) is not strong enough to make the micells diffuse
	val = 0.2	(N=300) a very strong tendency to cluster, potential micells are even disrupted to create a large hub
			a lot of numerical errors
	val = 0.3	(N=300) the tendency to cluster is so large that hubs merge
			a lot of numerical errors
			(N=1000)
	val = 0.8	(N=1000) very strong tendency to cluster. The hubs are even merged into one large hub, which causes a acceleration of the lipids to 'hurry' to the large beneficial space
	val = 1.0	(N=1000)
